# Portfolio
> My own personal portfolio.

The frontend for my portfolio written in the ever changing angular2. Started out with the release candidate and trying to keep up from there.

## Techniques

#### Server

The server is written in PHP and uses the following frameworks:
* Slim framework (https://github.com/slimphp/Slim)
* Eloquent (https://github.com/illuminate/database)

### Client

The client is written in javascript. My main purpose with choosing angular2 is to get familair with the new concepts behind the release candidate.
* Angular2 (https://angular.io)
* Typescript (https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* Angular-cli (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
